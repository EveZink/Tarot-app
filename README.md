# Tarot-app
1. A Tarot game based app, that allows users to spend playful  time by reaching to answers of wisdom. Includes Tarot pictures, meanings, descriptions and short advices - each.
2. Consists of 2 files: "images" (a file with pictures) and tarot_cards.py (a Python file): copy both files to Pycharm and RUN the .py file. You must get the empty desk of Tarot readings that says at the bottom:"Think of a question and pick a card"("Sugalvok klausimą ir versk kortą") - click the button - that must be done. You can play it as many times as you want, and when it is enough - click "Exit" ("išeiti").
